# Slide-it
Personal Project

For the current app I am using the MERN stack.
The idea for the for the application is just gathering all people who like cars into one app and posting their vehicles to be seen by other entusiasts.
Also you can simply use the app to check the weather in places you are planning to go.

The app is pretty straight forward, starting form register and login pages, leading the user to their Account page and Home page where the user is able to see all cars which are registered in the application.
For the authentication i am using Firebase , both for frontend and backend.
For weather forecast i am using OpenWeather api.

# Fucntionalities
